<b>An online scam is any use of internet technology to defraud people. Internet scams are carried out by cybercriminals for some type of personal gain, financial or otherwise. Scammers use deceptive methods like phishing emails, fake websites, and malicious software to gain access to their victims’ data, files, and personal information. They may steal their victims’ credit card data and Social Security numbers, access their bank accounts and medical records, or even trick them into willingly giving them their money.<br><br>

Common types of Online Scam:
<br><br>
<font color="yellow" size="+3">
Spear Phishing
<br><br><font color="white" size="+3">
Spear phishing is the act of sending deceptive emails to individuals, groups, and organizations in an effort to gain access to their private information. Instead of just randomly sending out these emails to millions of addresses, hackers send them only to specific targets whose addresses they have acquired via social media or stolen email records. To make the scam seem more realistic, hackers will often pretend that they are the victim’s business partner and address them by their name rather than using a generic intro.<br>

<br>Lottery Scams<br><br>
<font color="white" size="+3">
There’s probably not an internet user that hasn’t received at least one lottery scam email in their lifetime. Many inexperienced users have fallen victim to this scam over years and sent money to the scammers. These messages inform potential victims that they have won a large sum of money, but that they have to pay a small fee in order to claim their prize. In some cases, scammers may even set up their own fake online payment terminal that will also give them access to the victims’ credit card info.<br>

<br>Greeting Card Scams<br><br><font color="white" size="+3">
Usually sent out around big holidays, greeting card scam emails inform you that you have received an animated greeting card from a friend or a family member, but there’s a catch. Namely, to view your greeting card, you must click on the link included in the mail and download a piece of software, usually Flash Player. However, instead of Flash Player, you will download a piece of malicious software that will allow hackers to track your activity, access your files and documents, and even record your keystrokes.

<br>Advance Fee Scams<br><br><font color="white" size="+3">
Also known as a Nigerian scam, an advance fee scam usually starts with a poorly written emotional email allegedly sent by someone from a war-torn country whose parent has left them a large sum of money. They will ask you to let them transfer the funds to your bank account in exchange for 20% of the sum. <br>

<font color="yellow" size="+3">
<br>Killer Scams<br><br><font color="white" size="+3">
Killer scams involve an email sent by an alleged assassin who has been hired by an unnamed person to murder you. In this email, they will tell you that the only way to avoid death is to pay them thousands of dollars within a small timeframe, typically no more than 48 hours. These emails may contain personal information collected from your social media profiles to make the threat seem more real.
